```
docker-compose up
```
Wait for the installation until the message `Connected on port 3001` appears in your terminal.

Open your `Google Chrome` browser and enter the following link:

[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

Wait until the application starts.

#### Testing the application

The back-end of this application has unit tests for the Controllers. **To run them and check test coverage, follow these instructions:**

Navigate to the `server` directory
```
cd /server
```
Install dependencies:
```

</div>

To search for a task by its title, search in the field indicated with the desired terms and click on the `Search` button. If any tasks are found, only tasks that have the search term in their title will be displayed in the calendar.

To cancel the search, click the `Cancel Search` button so that all tasks are updated and re-listed in the calendar

## API Endpoints
This API has the following endpoints:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET - localhost:3001/tasks` | Returns all tasks registered in the Database. |
| `GET - localhost:3001/tasks/search` | Returns all tasks that satisfy the search term. |
| `POST - localhost:3001/tasks` | Create a new task. |
| `PUT - localhost:3001/tasks/:id` | Updates an existing task with new information. |
| `DELETE - localhost:3001/tasks/:id` | Deletes a task. |

## Using the API
The following examples uses [Isomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to make the requests, however you can use other tools, if you prefer.
